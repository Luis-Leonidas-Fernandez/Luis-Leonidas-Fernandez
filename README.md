🚀 About Me

I'm a Full-Stack & Flutter Developer with over 2.5 years of experience building real-time mobile apps, backend services, and automation systems.
I also have 2+ years specializing in Node.js, delivering production-ready software as a freelancer.
I’ve built complete end-to-end ecosystems, including a full Uber-style mobility platform consisting of:



🚗 User App (Flutter) — real-time tracking, Mapbox routing, dynamic pricing, cronómetro, notifications

🚕 Driver App (Flutter) — background location, trip assignment, pricing

🖥️ Admin Web Panel — dashboards, JWT auth, trip management

🧩 Backend (Node.js / MVC) — sockets, microservices, driver assignment engine

🛠️ DevOps — DigitalOcean VPS, Nginx, SSL, MongoDB, and CI/CD pipelines for Flutter

I'm also developing a uShip-style logistics platform (Duelo Envios) with:

Frontend: Flutter (MVVM)

Backend: Node.js (MVC)

Goal: freight delivery, bidding, real-time tracking, and payment integration

🤖 AI Engineering & Automation

In recent months, I’ve expanded into AI engineering, creating a multi-service ecosystem focused on automation, marketing intelligence, and retrieval systems.

🧠 vector-database-rag

(In development — Hexagonal Architecture, Multi-Tenant)
A scalable RAG platform providing:

File ingestion with Docling

OpenAI embeddings

Storage in MongoDB + Qdrant

IP & user-based rate limiting

Caching for improved retrieval

Multi-file support

Domain-driven, hexagonal design

Workflow:
A user uploads customer data → asks a question →
the LLM generates a structured table (e.g., “Which clients bought a Ford Ranger this year?”) →
the user creates a marketing segment from the result.

The segment is then sent to my second service:

📣 ford-mailer

(In development — MVC)
A campaign engine that executes:

Mass emails via Resend.io

WhatsApp Business API messaging

Workflow automation for campaign initialization and tracking

Together, these projects form a complete AI-driven data pipeline:
ingest → embed → query → segment → campaign → delivery.

📚 Learning & Growth

I'm currently strengthening my academic foundation by studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, focusing on machine learning, statistics, and modern AI architectures.

I'm also improving my English from A2 to B2, aiming for future international opportunities in markets such as Japan, Italy, and South Korea.

My long-term vision is to combine software engineering, AI, and automation to build scalable, high-impact solutions for global businesses.
