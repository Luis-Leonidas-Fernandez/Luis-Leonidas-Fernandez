## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software developer with more than 2.5 years of experience building mobile and web applications.
I specialize in creating Uber-style ride-sharing systems and uShip-style logistics platforms, using:

Flutter for mobile apps

Node.js + MongoDB for backend services (over 2 years of backend experience)

DigitalOcean VPS for deployment and infrastructure

For the past 4 months, I’ve also been working on:

AI-powered automations

RAG pipelines

Deployment of open-source and commercial LLMs

Building internal AI tools and assistants for business workflows


I am currently exploring new opportunities in software automation and applied artificial intelligence.
